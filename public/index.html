          <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>
              I love to build useful objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been doing it my whole life.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love to learn new ways to build anything useful.
            </p>
            <p>I've built props for theaters, sets for movies, shelves for books, and violins for musicians.</p> 
            <p>I've built a pizza oven in my backyard and a shelter for it when it started to rain. </p>
            <p>I've baked pies (they are very useful - ask your belly), and sewn costumes.</p>
            <p>
              My love of making things has brought me to web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I see it as a new way to make useful things for real people.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would love to build something for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Something useful.
            </p>
            <p>
              That works.
            </p>

            <p>When asked to build a learning app, Git jumped to mind immediately as 
              something I wanted to... um... get better at. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class='project-title'>Git Better </span>uses a spaced-repitition 
              algorithm to make questions you miss 
              show up more frequently than questions you get right.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class='project-title'>Git Better </span> was built with React and Redux
              on the front-end, Node.js with Express on the back, 
              and everything is stored in a MongoDB database with a Mongoose interface.

            <p>
              <span class='project-title'>Study Group </span>came about as I was looking 
              for a problem in my personal environment to solve. My code school is an online 
              program that happens to have many students in the Portland area. People in 
              the program often try to schedule study sessions in Slack,
              and I thought there could be a better way.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class='project-title'>Study Group </span> was built with React and Redux 
              on the front end, MongoDB with Mongoose for storage, and Node.js with Express
              to connect the two.

            <p>
              I love to pub sing. There is nothing quite like a rousing chorus of "Cousin Jack." 
              However, sometimes John isn't at the pub to lead that particular song, and while I 
              know the tune, I don't know the words. Also, I'm pretty busy these days and don't
              get to sings that often...and it would be nice to remind myself of some words before 
              I have to sing them in front of people. This is what
              <span class='project-title'> Song Cellar</span> was created for. It's a place to store 
              song lyrics for quick reference.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <span class='project-title'>Song Cellar's </span> front-end was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
              utilizing jQuery for DOM manipulation. The back-end uses Node.js
              with Express, and the data is stored in a MongoDB with Mongoose models and methods.
              Mocha and Chai were used for testing, and Travis CI for contiuous integration.
